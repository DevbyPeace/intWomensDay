     <span class="key-milestones" id="mile"> <h1> KEY MILESTONES IN WOMEN'S HISTORY</h1></span>
    <div class="milestones">
        <div> <h1>1848</h1>
             Seneca Falls Convention
            The first women's rights convention in the U.S. was held in Seneca Falls, New York. Organized by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, this event marked the beginning of the formal women‚Äôs suffrage movement. The Declaration of Sentiments, modeled after the Declaration of Independence, was drafted, demanding equal social, civil, and religious rights for women.
        </div>
        <div> <h1>1869</h1>
            First Woman Votes in the U.S.
            Wyoming became the first U.S. territory to grant women the right to vote. A year later, in 1870, Louisa Swain became the first woman to legally vote in a U.S. election. Wyoming‚Äôs progressive stance set a precedent for other states to follow.
        
        </div>
        <div><h1>1893</h1>
            New Zealand Grants Women the Right to Vote
            New Zealand made history by becoming the first country to grant women the right to vote in national elections. This was largely due to the activism of Kate Sheppard, a leader in the suffrage movement. Her work inspired similar movements worldwide.
        </div>
        <div> <h1>1896</h1>
            First Women's Olympic Event
            For the first time in history, women competed in the Olympics during the 1896 Athens Games. While initially limited to a few sports like tennis and golf, this milestone paved the way for greater female participation in athletics.
        </div>
        <div><h1>1913</h1> 
            Women‚Äôs Suffrage March in Washington, D.C.
            On March 3, 1913, over 5,000 women marched down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., demanding the right to vote. Organized by Alice Paul and the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), this protest gained national attention and pressured the U.S. government to take women‚Äôs rights seriously.</div>
        <div> <h1>1920</h1>
            19th Amendment Passed (USA)
            After decades of activism, the 19th Amendment was ratified, granting women in the U.S. the right to vote. Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and other suffragists dedicated their lives to this fight, finally securing victory after years of protests, hunger strikes, and lobbying.</div>
        <div> <h1>1928</h1>Equal Voting Rights in the UK
            British women won full voting rights with the Representation of the People Act of 1928. Unlike the 1918 law that only allowed women over 30 with property to vote, this new law granted voting rights to all women over 21, making them equal to men in the electoral process.</div>
        <div> <h1>1932</h1> 
            Amelia Earhart Flies Solo Across the Atlantic
            Aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. Her flight from Newfoundland to Ireland took 14 hours and 56 minutes, proving that women could excel in aviation. She remains an icon of courage and ambition.</div>
        <div> <h1>1955</h1>
            <h4>Rosa Parks Sparks the Civil Rights Movement</h4>

            On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Her arrest led to the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a pivotal event in the Civil Rights Movement. Parks‚Äô bravery became a symbol of resistance against racial and gender inequality.</div>
        <div><h1>1963</h1>Equal Pay Act Passed (USA)
            The Equal Pay Act of 1963 was a landmark U.S. law that prohibited gender-based wage discrimination. It aimed to close the wage gap between men and women, ensuring that women were paid fairly for equal work.</div>
      
        <div> <h1>1981</h1>Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor Becomes the First Female U.S. Supreme Court Justice
            President Ronald Reagan appointed Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor as the first female justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. Her appointment shattered barriers in the legal profession, and she became a key figure in shaping American law.</div>
        <div> <h1>1993</h1> UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women
            The United Nations General Assembly adopted this declaration, recognizing gender-based violence as a human rights violation. This was a major step toward legal protections for women worldwide, bringing attention to issues like domestic violence, sexual harassment, and human trafficking.</div>
        <div><h1>2005</h1> Ellen Johnson Sirleaf Becomes Africa‚Äôs First Female Head of State
            Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was elected as President of Liberia, becoming Africa‚Äôs first female head of state. Her leadership in post-civil-war Liberia focused on rebuilding the nation, promoting women‚Äôs rights, and fighting corruption. She later won a Nobel Peace Prize for her contributions.</div>
        <div> <h1>2018</h1> Saudi Women Gain the Right to Drive

        Malala Yousafzai was just 15 years old when she was targeted by the Taliban for speaking out about girls' education in Pakistan. Surviving a near-fatal attack, Malala refused to be silenced. Instead, she amplified her voice, becoming a global advocate for education.
        
        In 2014, she became the youngest-ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate at just 17 years old. Today, the Malala Fund helps provide education for millions of girls worldwide. Her courage proves that no obstacle is too great when you stand for what‚Äôs right.

        "It‚Äôs the little things citizens do. That‚Äôs what will make the difference. My little thing is planting trees." ‚Äì Wangari Maathai
        
        In 1977, Wangari Maathai launched the Green Belt Movement in Kenya, inspiring millions to plant trees and combat deforestation. Despite facing opposition from political leaders, she remained steadfast in her mission.
        
        Her efforts led to the planting of over 50 million trees, empowering women by providing jobs and protecting the environment. In 2004, she became the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize, proving that environmental conservation and women's rights go hand in hand.

        A brilliant mathematician, Katherine Johnson was one of the pioneering Black women in NASA, breaking barriers in a male-dominated field. She played a critical role in calculating flight paths for John Glenn‚Äôs orbital mission (1962) and the Apollo 11 moon landing (1969).
        
        Despite facing racism and gender discrimination, she proved that intelligence and determination could overcome any challenge. Her story was featured in the film Hidden Figures, bringing her legacy to light for new generations.

        Kalpana Chawla defied expectations and became the first Indian woman in space in 1997. She inspired millions of young girls in India and beyond to dream of the stars.
        
        Tragically, her second space mission aboard the Columbia shuttle (2003) ended in disaster when the shuttle disintegrated upon re-entry. Despite this, her legacy continues to inspire a new generation of women in space exploration and engineering.
